     <h2>Write a short explanation of what a variable is and why it's used in javascript.</h2>
     <p> In JavaScript, a variable serves as a named container for storing data. allowing developers to manage and manipulate information efficiently within their code.</p>
     <p><h3>Definition of a Variable</h3>
        A variable in JavaScript is essentially a named storage location for values—these values can be various data types such as numbers, strings, or objects. This capability is crucial for programming, 
        as it enables the organization and retrieval of data throughout the code.Purpose of Using Variables
        Variables are used to simplify data management within a program. They allow developers to store reusable values that can be referenced multiple times, avoiding the need to repeat literal values throughout the code. This practice not only makes the code more readable but also aids in maintaining and updating applications</p>
